üì¶ **Features**

- **Prebuilt Workflows**: The tool comes with five prebuilt workflows out of the box, including opening websites, checking the weather forecast, opening a mail client, and fetching the latest news.

- **Custom Workflow Manager**: You can create and manage your own custom workflows using the "Command Manager" option. This allows you to automate your unique tasks and commands.

- **User-Friendly Menu**: The CLI presents a user-friendly menu with options for running prebuilt workflows, managing custom workflows, and exiting the tool.

üí° **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/cli-startup-tool.git](https://github.com/NotSooShariff/CommandSage.git)
   cd CommandSage
   ```

2. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. And then use the following command to install pip dependencies:

    ```python
    pip install os requests sys
    ```

3. **Customise it**: Grab an API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) if you want the grabbing latest news functionality. And edit it in the `boot.py` by replacing the hashes in `NEWS_API_KEY = '###################'`. You can also make a [Custom Banner Art](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20) when it starts up instead of `Osh's Sage` displayed right now.  

3. **Run the Tool**: To run the CLI tool, simply execute the main Python script:

   ```
   python boot.py
   ```

   This will launch the tool and present you with the main menu.

4. **Use Prebuilt Workflows**: You can choose from the prebuilt workflows directly from the menu. These include options to open websites, check the weather, and more.

5. **Create Custom Workflows**: To create custom workflows, select the "Command Manager" option from the menu. This will allow you to define your own commands and workflows.

6. **Add to .bashrc / .zhrc (Optional)**: To make the tool run on startup, you can add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

   ```
   alias mystartup="python /path/to/boot.py"
   mystartup
   ```

   This creates an alias `mystartup` that automatically launches every time you start the terminal or you can run the alias from your terminal to launch the tool.

üõ†Ô∏è **Command Manager**

The "Command Manager" is where you can create and manage your custom workflows. Here's how it works:

- **Display Command Flows**: View a list of your existing custom workflows.

- **Add Command Flow**: Create a new custom workflow by specifying a name and a list of commands.

- **Delete Command Flow**: Delete an existing custom workflow.

- **Execute Command Flow**: Run a specific custom workflow, optionally providing input values.

üìù **Example Usage**

Here's an example of how you can use the tool to simplify your daily tasks:

1. Use the prebuilt workflows to quickly access your favorite websites and check the weather forecast.
2. 

3. Create a custom workflow named "DailyReport" that runs a series of commands to generate a daily report. You can add this to the "Command Manager."

4. Add the tool to your `~/.bashrc` file to have it automatically launch on startup.

üöß **Limitations**

- The tool currently supports only five prebuilt workflows, but it can be easily extended by adding more options in the main menu.

- The "Command Manager" functionality is basic and doesn't provide advanced features like conditional logic or error handling. It's intended for simple automation.
